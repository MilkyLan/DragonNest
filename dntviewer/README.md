# dntviewer
Javascript viewer for Dragon Nest Table files

The viewer is hosted here:
http://spacem.github.io/dntviewer

I do not host the actual DNT files on github.

There are two ways to use:

1.
* Extract the pak files
* Drag the xml file uistring.xml to the box on the right
* Drag a dnt file to the box on the left
* Click autotranslate to apply strings from uistring.xml to the dnt file
* Use the grid or export as csv

2.
* Someone hosts the xml and dnt files (these can be zipped)
* For now the hosting needs to have Access-Control-Allow-Origin in the headers
* Click the hosted files link (http://spacem.github.io/dntviewer/hostedfiles.html)
* Fill the box with the url of the hosted files
* Click a link to load the file from that location
